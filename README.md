# API GATEWAY OF AIRLINEBOOKING SYSTEM

FRONT END -- MIDDLE END -- BACKEND

We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices

This middle end helps in rate limiting, request transformation, message validation

Using this middle end, when client sends a request we will be able to make decision which microservice should actually respond to this service.

We will prepare an API Gateway for this middle end.
